# Sampler

The `Sampler` class is an abstract base class that provides the foundation for sampling particles from various sources.

## Constructor

```typescript
new Sampler()
```

## Parameters

This is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated directly.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `geometry` | `THREE.BufferGeometry` | Source geometry for sampling |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `build()` | Builds the sampler's internal data structures |
| `sample(target: THREE.Vector3)` | Samples a single point and stores the result |
| `setWeightAttribute(name: string)` | Sets weight attribute for sampling distribution |

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { MeshSurfaceSampler } from 'particlize';

// Create sampler
const sampler = new MeshSurfaceSampler(mesh)
  .setWeightAttribute('color')
  .build();

// Sample points
const position = new THREE.Vector3();
for (let i = 0; i < particleCount; i++) {
  sampler.sample(position);
  // Use position data
}
```
