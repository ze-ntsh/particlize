- [ ] Switch from acceleration to force and mass
- [ ] Add a way to set the mass of the object
- [ ] Add a way to add forces to the system
- [ ] Morphing
- [ ] Add postprocessing
- [ ] Allow users to set custom properties
- [ ] Allow for custom shaders wherever possible
- [ ] Add a way to set the color of the particles (maps, textures, etc.)
- [ ] Add a line constraint (draws lines between particles). Can be applied between any two particles
- [ ] Allow for users to be able to access random particles and change their properties
- [ ] Make forces toggleable
- [ ] Add more samplers for meshes
- [ ] Mouse events
- [ ] Add a way to maybe group particles. Physics becomes easier ? (center of mass, etc.)
